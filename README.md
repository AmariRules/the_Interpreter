# the_Interpreter
Interpreter program for a mock language X, X is considered a simplified version of Java

The interpreter is responsible for processing byte codes that are created from the source code files with the extension x. The interpreter and the Virtual Machine works together to run a program written in the Language X.


How to Build:
You must first have an IDE or some Java Development environment project on your system. 
If you do not, I recommend installing Intelli-J or Netbeans. For my example I will be using Intelli-J. 
After installing a IDE on your computer. 
Download the project and open your preferred IDE. 

Using Intelli-J: 
click on New-> New project -> Project from Existing Sources. 
After doing so You will have a prompt to find the file, then click on the master folder and you will build with existing sources. Following this the computer will build the project for you. 

To Run: 
If you have done the previous step correctly, you can click over through project and click down the file tree. 

interpreter -> Interpreter.java

Click on the Interpreter.java class. 

While open, navigate to the right corner of the IDE and click the window that has Interpreter next to a play button. 
If you click this Interpreter pulldown menu you can configure it by clicking edit configurations. 

When this window pops open you can add into the programs arguments the name of file that has bytecode instructions in it.
For this code the test will be: 

Fib.x.cod     or     Factorial.x.cod

Following this configuration, you can click run next to the pulldown menu you clicked earlier or you can right click the Interpreter.Java file and click run code from the menu.
